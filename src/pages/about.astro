      <p>
        DDEV is a local development environment for web developers. It
        originated within the company “Drud” in about 2016. Drud was building a
        general-purpose CLI for its infant web hosting product (named
        “DDEV-Live”, with the local dev tool named “DDEV-Local”), and the and
        was visionary enough to build local development into the idea. (Nobody
        really remembers what “DDEV” stands for, it might be “Docker
        development” or it might have been “Drud development”.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The independent value of the tool was soon recognized and it was
        refactored into its own repository, and then made open-source and it
        began its journey. Randy Fay was an employee of Drud in this period, and
        as a long-time proponent of local development and debugging was sold on
        its value. Drud graciously sponsored Randy to work on DDEV for nearly
        five years, until it lost its funding. DDEV of course had integration to
        Drud’s hosting product during this period, and it was seen as a way to
        bring developers into the Drud-hosting world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company Drud (by then renamed “DDEV”) shut down in 2021 when it lost
        its venture funding. Randy Fay continued to maintain the project without
        interruption.
