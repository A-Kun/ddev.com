      <p>
        DDEV is an actively-developed, open source project for managing
        Docker-based local development environments. Itâ€™s primarily been
        PHP-based, but has grown with support for the Node.js ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is maintained primarily by Randy Fay, who oversees
        development, testing, and support with the help of volunteers and the
        broader community. Development is supported by Platform.sh and many
        individual sponsors.
      </p>
      <p>DDEV-Local was first released by a company called Drud in 19XX.</p>
