Jeffrey A. “jam” McGuire, Partner at Open Strategy Partners – In demand as a global keynote speaker and communications expert, he has built a strong following at the intersection of open source software, business, and culture. Over the last decade, while helping Acquia grow from 18 to 800 employees, he created value-multiplying connections between people, companies, and projects in the open source, government, and business worlds. His unique approach to content marketing–making human stories out of complex technology solutions and celebrating the expertise and success of their creators–left its mark on the company and the open source communities around it.
