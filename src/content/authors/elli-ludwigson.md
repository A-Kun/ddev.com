Elli Ludwigson is fueled by her fundamental curiosity about what connects us, literally and metaphorically. She has an innate drive to connect information and resources with stakeholders and communities. She has supported United States Members of Congress while working at the Congressional Research Service, promoted the core concepts of the sustainable food movement for a New York Times bestselling author and farmer, and contributed to the Drupal open source project as a core mentoring lead. Elli will happily dive deep into just about any topic, whether it's the inner workings of a technology or the history of Joy of Cooking (she collects old editions). She currently resides outside of Washington DC with her books, houseplants, and baking habit.
