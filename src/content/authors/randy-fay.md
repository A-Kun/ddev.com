Randy loves dueling with computers and his career has spanned Apple ][ home automation, Unix/Linux kernel driver development, Windows, Drupal, and loads of fun system administration and DevOps work. After years of Drupal work he's delighted to be working on DDEV-Local, which provides an easy way to do web development locally.
