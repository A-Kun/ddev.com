Rick graduated from MIT with a BS and PhD in Materials Science and Engineering (where he also coached track and field) and quickly became a valued member of the team shortly after joining newmedia in 2012. If you ever want to know about the quantum electrodynamic interactions of carbon nanotube systems, he’s your guy! In addition to his considerable talent in all things technical, his specific expertise is in understanding the big picture, and helping identify challenges and provide solutions long before a problem has a chance to develop. His analogous nickname here is the Swiss Army Knife. Rick’s a software developer, media technologist and project manager, but please don’t ask him to design anything. We all have our limits. Rick loves to learn, share, and connect with like-minded people, and he lives in the greater Denver area with his wife Emily and their dog Linus.
