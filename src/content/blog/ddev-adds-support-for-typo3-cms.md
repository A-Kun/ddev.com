We’re on a mission to make it easier for developers, teams, and organizations to adopt modern container-based toolsets and workflows. To get there we’re expanding our support to new communities and platforms. Today we’re excited to announce that DDEV integrates with the TYPO3 CMS to provide a fast and robust way to work across multiple projects and across multiple operating systems. Once you have DDEV installed, you can get a new TYPO3 site up and running on your local workstation in minutes.

> “Thanks to DDEV, I can have a state-of-the-art, container-based TYPO3 CMS installation up-and-running in minutes. It is pure convenience and a joy to use, both in my day job at a digital agency and as a contributor.”
>
> – Susi Moog, TYPO3 CMS core developer

### Going Further

You can find all the details in our [community documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but we think you’ll want to know these facts to make your day easier now.

- Project Info: Run `ddev describe` to access database credentials and other services.
- Developer Tools: Access MailHog, phpMyAdmin, and more right out of the gates.
- Hooks: Common tasks you need to run can be version controlled and shared.
- List: Running two or more projects? Run `ddev list` to keep on top of them all.
- Additional Services: Add new containers (e.g. Apache Solr) quickly.

## How can we make DDEV better for your community?

We’re all open source engineers and contributors behind the scenes here. We love feedback because it lets us know we’re building the features (and fixing the problems) that are important to you. Submit your feedback, patches, pull requests, comments, and questions in the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/drud/ddev), in the [#ddev channel](https://typo3.slack.com/messages/C8TRNQ601) in the TYPO3 Community Slack, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drud) (tag tweets with #typo3 and #ddev).

## DDEV + TYPO3 – Agency technology meets agency community

In the interview video below, TYPO3 GmbH CEO Mathias Schreiber and DDEV CEO Steve Grandchamp sat down with Jeffrey A. “jam” McGuire recently at TYPO3 HQ in Düsseldorf, Germany, to talk about how DDEV and TYPO3 came together at just the right time to provide this needed solution to the open source community.

### Tymoteusz “Tymek” Motylewski on DDEV + TYPO3 CMS

We spoke with Tymoteusz Motylewski about using the new TYPO3 CMS integration with DDEV’s local PHP development environment. “Tymek” is the CTO of [Macopedia Agile Software House](http://macopedia.com/) and a TYPO3 CMS core developer.

What did you think when you heard about DDEV? “The idea sounded interesting and when I tried it, I was amazed at the simplicity of the solution. We had tried using pure Docker before, but that was very complicated. Just to set up an environment, you’d need Docker training; you need to type long commands setting what feels like 1000s of switches.

**“DDEV really simplifies the process lot. It is super fast and super simple.** Type `ddev start` and you have your machine. The best part is that with the predefined TYPO3 CMS Docker image, your testing environment is up and running in 30 seconds.

“You have all the benefits of Docker, you work on local files, there’s no need to sync with external systems. We’ve been using Vagrant plus VirtualBox at Macopedia and syncing files, like for compiling Sass to CSS would often cause glitches. DDEV is all on local and gives me more peace-of-mind because it eliminates the need for that altogether.

“Virtual machines take up too much space. Every VirtualBox reserves a space on my system–20 or 30 GB sometimes–and the space is permanently reserved. At some point, they just eat up my hard drive.

**“I am working on switching my whole team Vagrant + VirtualBox to DDEV at Macopedia asap. You should try it today.”**
