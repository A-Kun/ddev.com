# ddev.com Front End

This repositoryâ€™s source code is for [ddev.com](https://ddev.com)â€™s statically-generated front end. Itâ€™s built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern static site generator with all the development fancy youâ€™d hope for but that only ships whatâ€™s necessary for the visitor. It helps us keep things organized, maintainable, and fast for visitors.

Most pages are built using plain old Astro components, while blog posts are sourced from local Markdown.

## Setup

The project includes an `.nvmrc` file, so if you have `nvm` installed you can run `nvm use` to make sure youâ€™re running an appropriate Node.js version.

After that, run `npm install` to set up the projectâ€™s dependencies. Then you can run any of the [commands](#commands) below.

> ðŸ’¡ Thereâ€™s also a `.prettierrc` file in the project thatâ€™ll save you formatting time and keep things consistent if youâ€™re using Prettier in your editor or IDE.

Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` and see if it works or falls over.

## Ingredients

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Tailwind Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) plugin
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com)

## Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Thereâ€™s nothing special about `src/components/`, but thatâ€™s where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Youâ€™ll also see a `lib/` directory with common methods for fetching and formatting content.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
